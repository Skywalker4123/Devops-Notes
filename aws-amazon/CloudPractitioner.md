# AWS CERTIFIED CLOUD PRACTITIONER

### Fundamentals of Cloud Computing Platform.
#### Data Center Approach
- Requirement: Your company wants to host their website.
- Solution: 
  * Choose the DataCenter/Hosting Provider
  * You need to typically send them enquiry about your requirements
  * They will contact you and price negociations.

Could computing is a model in which computing resources are available as a service. So we can customize based on our requiriments on a specific time.

Example 1:
Due to some big promotion, server capacity needs to be increased from 4GB RAM to 32GB RAM.

- Data Center Provider Way:
  * Buy a 32 GB RAM stick & install it onto your server.
- Hosting Provider Way:
  * Raise a support ticket and expect response within 15 minutes to 12 hours for response.
  * Get the DC guys to resize your server.
- Cloud Way:
  * Stop the server & change the instance size.

#### Cloud computing
Cloud computing is a model in which computing resource are available as a service.
- 3 important characteristic of Cloud Computing:
  * On-demand & self serviced \[Any time launch without manual intervention\]
  * Elasticity.               \[Can scale up and down anytime\]
  * Measured Service          \[Pay what you use\]

###### Types of cloud computing
There are 3 types of Cloud Computing models.
- Software as a service           \[Google Docs, Office 365\]
- Platform as a service           \[Google App Engine\]
- Infrastructure as a service     \[AWS, Linode, Digital Ocean\]

#### Architecture of Cloud Environments

###### Cloud is Data Center secretly
Cloud from behind the scenes is data center only.
Virtualization allows us to run multiple OS on a single hardware.
There are many virtualization softwares available like:
- VMware Workstation / vSphere
- KVM
- XEN
- VirtualBox

Now typically virtualization allows us to run multiple operating system on a single hardware.

#### On-Demand & Self Service
###### Challenges
- On-Demand does not always means that you will be able to launch instances at any given point of time.
- Event a Cloud provider has limits, though it might be high, these limits are definitely reached.

#### Elasticity
- Elasticity deals with adding and removing capacity, whenever it is needed in the environment.
- Capacity generally refers to mostly processing & memory.
- It is like a rubber band. 

#### Scalability
- Horizontal Scalability: Adding or removing instances from pool like cluster farm.
- Vertical Scalability: Adding or removing resource for existing servers.


### Core AWS Services.
#### Pay as you go Model
- Pay as you consume model allows organizations to scale their resources well and only pay for what they have used.
- Generally, the model works based on hourly costs.
- This model is terrific especially due to AWS Marketplace support.
