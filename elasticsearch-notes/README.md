##### RUNNING ELASTICSEARCH AND KIBANA IN ELASTIC CLOUD
- Go to elastic cloud web page
- I will ask you to use AWS or Google Cloud Platform. However AWS already offers a elastic search feature, which has more funtionalities.

#### CONNECTING TO OUR CLUSTER
- Open the terminal for connecting through it .
- ```curl -u elastic:passoword elasticsearch-endpoint```
- Each time we try to connect, it should show us a different node.
- Fo accessing to kibana just click in the dashboard icon, then we will need to use the created credentials.
